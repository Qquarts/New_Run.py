## 🪶 1. Principles

This license is a declaration of a new open-code culture founded on **trust, record-keeping, and contribution**,  
rather than legal compulsion.  
All code represents human creative contribution, and its value is transparently proven  
through the public **PHAM Ledger**.

## 🌍 2. Open Use

Anyone may freely **read, copy, modify, research, and redistribute** this code.  
It may be used without restriction for **research, education, and non-profit activities**.  
The creation of new works utilizing part or all of the code is also permitted without restriction.

## 💠 3. Fair Contribution

If a project based on this code generates **commercial revenue**,  
the Creator *(Qquarts Co / GNJz)* shall not request compensation exceeding **6% of that revenue**  
or a mutually agreed-upon contribution rate.  

This ratio represents a **maximum limit**, not a legal obligation —  
a **reference standard for voluntary and fair contribution**.  
All compensation is **trust-based** and may be transparently recorded  
through the **PHAM Ledger** or any open transaction record.

The PHAM system operates through **Social Trust Enforcement**,  
not legal compulsion.  
Records of **contribution, usage, and compensation** are made public via the **PHAM Ledger**.  
Every contributor is entitled to trust and compensation proportional to their contribution.

## 💎 6. Cultural Statement

This license is not merely a **code contract**, but a **new ethical commitment**
