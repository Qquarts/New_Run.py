# 🌌 PHAM Neural Genesis v1.0  
**Official Release — Trust-Based Open Code Business System**  
(C) 2025 Qquarts Co / GNJz  

---

## 🧬 Overview
**PHAM Neural Genesis**  
is the world’s first **trust-based open business system**,  
combining scientific neuron modeling, blockchain-based record keeping,  
and open-source development culture.

> 🪶 **Code is the product. Ledger is the proof. Trust is the currency.**

In this project, the code itself is treated as an asset.  
Every modification and publication is transparently recorded in the public ledger,  
creating a new economic structure based on digital trust.

---

## 🔗 Verified Public Release (IPFS)

All official code and documents of **PHAM Neural Genesis v1.0**  
are permanently stored and verifiable on the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**.  
Anyone can verify their authenticity through the hash.

🌍 **Root CID:** `QmejFivibj4biuXXDjSzPgyC9VfE7b2J2crvqBX94HMh7B`  
🔗 **Direct Link:** [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmejFivibj4biuXXDjSzPgyC9VfE7b2J2crvqBX94HMh7B](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmejFivibj4biuXXDjSzPgyC9VfE7b2J2crvqBX94HMh7B)

> “This CID contains the verified full PHAM v3 source directory.  
> Each block is uniquely identified by its hash, immutable, and publicly auditable.”

## ⚙️ Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `new_run_quick.py` | The first self-circulating neuron code of the PHAM system |
| `pham_sign_v3.py` | Tool for code signing and ledger registration |
| `pham_chain_log_new_run_quick.json` | Blockchain-style ledger record of code changes |
| `LICENSE` | PHAM-OPEN LICENSE v1.0 (KR/EN, trust-based copyright agreement) |
| `README_ko.md` | Official Korean release notes and guide |

---

## 🌍 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Run and Experiment  
`python3 new_run_quick.py`  
→ Executes the neuron energy circulation simulation.  

### 2️⃣ Register Signature in Ledger  
`python3 pham_sign_v3.py new_run_quick.py "YourName" "Message"`  
→ The file’s hash is stored as a new block in `pham_chain_log_new_run_quick.json`.  
→ Optionally, an IPFS CID is also published.  

### 3️⃣ Verify Ledger  
`python3 view_chain_quick.py`  
→ Displays the full blockchain ledger and signature history.

## 📜 PHAM-OPEN LICENSE v1.0 (Trust-Based Edition)  

This project follows a trust-based open license without legal enforcement.    
All users are free to use the code for any purpose.    
When commercial profit is generated, up to 6% voluntary contribution is encouraged.    

**Core Principles**  
1. Free for research, education, and non-profit use.    
2. Up to 6% voluntary contribution for commercial applications.    
3. Proper credit must be given:    
   “Based on PHAM Neural Genesis — New_Run.py © Qquarts Co, 2025”    
4. Ledger hash and CID must not be altered or removed.    
5. All updates are transparently recorded in the PHAM Ledger.    

🪶 **Trust as Law. Ledger as Proof. Code as Culture.**  

For the full license text, see the `LICENSE` file.

## 💎 Contribution-Based Reward System  
 
The PHAM system extends beyond voluntary contribution —    
every ledger record becomes a stake of ownership in the ecosystem.    

- Every contributor signs (`pham_sign_v3.py`) their code, edit, or idea.    
- Each signature is stored on the blockchain ledger with timestamp, content, and CID.    
- Revenue generated within the PHAM ecosystem will be distributed automatically    
  based on contribution records. *(planned for v2.0)*  

💠 “Once you sign the ledger, your contribution becomes your asset.”    
This structure operates without a central authority — contribution equals ownership.    

---

## 🧠 Philosophy  

We choose record over law,    
trust over enforcement,    
sharing over possession.    

PHAM Neural Genesis redefines digital creation as a transparent ecosystem    
where developers and researchers prove value through trust and code itself.

## 🪩 How to Join  

### Clone and Run  
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/pham-neural-genesis.git  
cd pham-neural-genesis  
python3 new_run_quick.py  

### Register Your Signature  
python3 pham_sign_v3.py new_run_quick.py "YourName" "Genesis Participation"  

### Verify Ledger  
python3 view_chain_quick.py  

Once your name is recorded in the PHAM Ledger,  
it becomes your personal signature within the system.
